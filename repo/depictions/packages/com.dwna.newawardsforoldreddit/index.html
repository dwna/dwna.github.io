<p>
This brings Reddit's new award system to the official app version 3.13.1. You can now view silver and platinum awards that were given to comments and posts. 
</p>
<p>
As of version 1.0, there are three styles for the awards. They are the Flat, From Old Reddit, and From Redesign. The "Flat" set imitates the style of the original gold. 
The "From Old Reddit" set consists of images taken from old.reddit.com. The "From Redesign" set consists of images taken directly from, as you would guess, the Redesign.
This is the set used in the current version of the app. There is the option to keep the original gold icon, this overrides the gold image in the selected set. 
The "Flat" set is recommended with this enabled.
</p>

<p>
Note: This does not enable giving these awards, only viewing them. 
</p>

If you run into any issues, questions, or suggestions, message me on Reddit at /u/dwna or send me an email.
</p>

<p>
Future Plans: Add an option to enable posts' awards to be visible from compact view.
