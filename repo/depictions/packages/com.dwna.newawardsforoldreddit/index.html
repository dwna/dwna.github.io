<h3>
Info
</h3>

<p>
This brings Reddit's new award system to the official app version 3.13.1. You can now view silver and platinum awards that were given to comments and posts. As of version 1.0,
there are three styles for the awards. They are the Flat, From Old Reddit, and From Redesign. The "Flat" set imitates the style of the original gold. 
The "From Old Reddit" set consists of images taken from old.reddit.com. The "From Redesign" set consists of images taken directly from, as you would guess, the Redesign.
This is the set used in the current version of the app. There is the option to keep the original gold icon, this overrides the gold image in the selected set. 
The "Flat" set is recommeded with this enabled.
